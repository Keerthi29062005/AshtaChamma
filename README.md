# Indian Ludo Game (Ashta Chamma) - ReactJS

Welcome to the Indian Ludo Game (Ashta Chamma) repository! This project is built using ReactJS and aims to provide a digital version of the popular Indian board game. 
AshtaChamma is a traditional Indian board game that is similar to the game of Ludo.  The objective of the game is to move all of one's pieces from the starting point to the center of the board, following a prescribed path, before the other players do. In this game, we use gavvalu instead of dice to get the count of moves.
